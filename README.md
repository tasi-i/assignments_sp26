Questions to Answer
What is the difference between size and capacity?
Size is the number of elements that are currently stored in the Dynamic Array. While capacity is the total length of backing the array that the dynamic array can hold before it needs to resize.
When do we resize and why?
Well because when we have to much data there will be a time where the size is not big enough to store everything. We alway sneed size>=data length. Resizing ensures there is enough spave backing the array for new elements.
Which operations require shifting and why?
You need shifiting when you need to add or remove.  This is because you cannot just creative something new at the end its for when something need to be added in the middle. for example 124 I want to add 3 but I have to make a shift for that to happen.

Reflection
Please provide a brief reflection about your experience with this assignment. What was easiest? What was hardest? How did your understanding of arrays and lists evolve?
Get set and size was the easier part because it maps directky ro array access. While handling edge cases was harder.I feel like I had a good idea how size and lists worked. I gained more of a knowledge on how to shift elements.
